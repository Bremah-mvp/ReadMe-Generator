This involved gathering all the required resources needed this create this appliaction and determining how its 
going to function.

         TOOLS used to create the application.

JAVASCRIPT

This application was entirely javascript based. all the files need to get the application running were created with java script and put together to using visual studio.

NODE.JS

Node is a javascript library that provides additional functionalities that browsers cannot forexample access to local machine file directory.
I used node.js to run and create the appliaction with the commandline or terminal.

GITBASH

Used the gitbash terminal or commandline with node.js to create the application and produce the readme file which was sent to the github repository of the current directory for which the readme file was designated.

A user simply downloads the app from github to a desired directory and launch it through commandline or terminal.
A user is then presented with a series of prompt questions about his or her project or appliaction and simlpy has fill in the desired answers and then the readme-file will be created accordingly.
